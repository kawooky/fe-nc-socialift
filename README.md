## Conclusion

### Why I built this project this way?

We have decided to build this project in React Native, as we only had a small team of 5 developers and 14 days to plan and execute the idea. Using React Native means we can develop on numerous platforms at once, hitting both mobile and web markets. We have also decided to use Firebase in order to gain familiarity with a new database service, and we believed Google's offering will lay a solid foundation for this project.

### I gained confidence...

### If we had more time...

If we had more time to work on this project, we would finish the functionality, and improve the styling, inlcluding animations.
